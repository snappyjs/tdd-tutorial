# Requirement for CO2 Calculator

* Calculate the total CO2 from a vehicle by using the following calculation:
`aerodynamic drag` * `rolling resistance` * `weight` = `co2`

What questions should you ask business?

* With fixed input data - what would the output be?
* Are there any limitations to the input data?
* Are there any limitations / validations to the output data?


- Get the aerodynamic drag.
  - Validate the aerodynamic drag.
- Get the rolling resistance. 
  - Validate the rolling resistance.
- Get the weight.
  - Validate the weight.
- Calculate the co2.
  - Validate the output.


  aerodynamic drag = 0.1
  weight = 2125kg
  rolling resistance = 1 N/kN
  results = 212.5 gCO2/km
